            <h2>How to choose the perfect Pinterest Board Name</h2>
            <p>
                Pinterest is a visual search engine, which means the names you give your boards matter for SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
                A well-named board helps your content get discovered by the right people.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Be Descriptive</h3>
            <p>
                Avoid cute or clever names that don't explain what the board is about. Instead of "Yummystuff", use specific terms like "Healthy Vegan Dinner Recipes".
                This tells both Pinterest and users exactly what to expect.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Use Keywords</h3>
            <p>
                Think about what people would type into the search bar to find your content. Include those keywords in your board name.
                For example, if you pin home decor, use keywords like "Modern Living Room", "Small Bedroom Ideas", or "Boho Chic Decor".
            </p>

            <h3>3. Match Your Tone</h3>
            <p>
                Your board names should reflect your brand's personality. If you're a professional business, use clean, straightforward names.
                If you're a lifestyle blogger, you might use more fun or aesthetic names. Our tool generates names in 6 different tones so you can find the perfect match.

            <h3>4. Keep it Concise</h3>
            <p>
                While you want to be descriptive, keep your names short enough to be easily readable on mobile devices.
                Aim for 20-50 characters.
